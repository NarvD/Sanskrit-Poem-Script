# SanskritPoemScript Standard Library

SanskritPoemScript comes with a built-in standard library that provides a set of useful functions for common tasks. Here is a list of the functions in the standard library:

## `vani()`

The `vani()` function is used to print text to the console. It takes a single argument, which is the text to be printed. Here is an example:

vani(“Namaste, Jagat!”)

Output:

Namaste, Jagat!

## `karya()`

The `karya()` function is used to define a new function in SanskritPoemScript. Here is an example:

karya greet(name)
vani("Namaste, " + name + “!”)

To call the `greet()` function, you simply use its name with parentheses and pass in the arguments:

greet(“Jagat”)


Output:

Namaste, Jagat!
