# SanskritPoemScript Syntax

SanskritPoemScript is a unique programming language that combines the beauty of Classical Sanskrit Poetry with the functionality of modern programming languages. In this document, you will learn about the basic syntax of SanskritPoemScript.

## Functions

Functions in SanskritPoemScript are defined using the `karya` keyword. Here is an example of a simple function:
karya greet(name)
vani("Namaste, " + name + “!”)

To call a function, you simply use its name with parentheses and pass in the arguments:

greet(“Jagat”)

## Variables

Variables in SanskritPoemScript are declared using the `yojana` keyword. Here is an example of a variable declaration:

yojana age = 30


You can also declare multiple variables in a single line by separating them with commas:

yojana name = “Ram”, surname = “Sharma”

## Control Structures

SanskritPoemScript supports basic control structures like `yadi` (if) and `yavat` (while). Here is an example of an `if` statement:

yojana x = 5
yadi x > 10
vani(“x is greater than 10”)
ma
vani(“x is less than or equal to 10”)

## Comments

You can add comments to your SanskritPoemScript code using the `//` symbol. Any text after `//` on a line is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter:

// This is a comment
karya greet(name)
// Another comment
vani("Namaste, " + name + “!”)
